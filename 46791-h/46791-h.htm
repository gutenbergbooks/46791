<p><i>The Old Couple. A Comedy. By Thomas May, Esq.;</i>
<i>London, Printed by J. Cottrel, for Samuel Speed, at</i>
<i>the signe of the Printing-press in S. Paul's Churchyard.</i>
<i>1658. 4<sup>o</sup>.</i></p></div>

<p>[A MS. note in one of the former editions says:
"This comedy is pleasingly and fluently written, and
though it contains little poetry, is not without some
eloquent and beautiful passages. The first scene is the
best in the play."]</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>It seems probable that this comedy, as it is called, was
never acted, and on the title-page of the old edition
(not printed until 1658, eight years after the death of
the author), it is not mentioned that it was performed
by any private or public company. This fact was
usually stated, though during the period when the
theatres were silenced exceptions were not very
uncommon. It is pretty obvious, however, from the
general structure of the piece and the nature of the
dialogue, that "The Old Couple" was not calculated or
intended by the author to please the multitude. No
inconsiderable part of the plot, and some of the
characters, may be considered allegorical, and for the
sake of preserving it, some constraint is used in a few
of the incidents, and forced and unnatural conversions
take place among the persons.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>As to the period when it was written, judging from
internal evidence, it might be thought that May produced
"The Old Couple" late in life, and it was certainly
the last printed of any of his works. It will be
observed that two lines in the last scene of this play
close "The Goblins" of Sir John Suckling.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">"Gently my joys distil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest you should break the vessel you should fill."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sir J. Suckling does not introduce them as a quotation,
but nevertheless, from the situation in which
they are found in his comedy, it seems likely that they
were so, and that they originally belong to May. If
this supposition be correct, "The Old Couple" must
have been written before 1641, in which year Suckling
died, and the latter must have seen it in MS.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<span class="i0">Her beauteous presence to all else, and shine<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When I, without control alone might spend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweet Artemia in these fragrant walks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day's short-seeming hours; and (ravish'd) hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sweet discourses of the lily's whiteness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blushing rose, blue-mantled violet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale daffodil, and purple hyacinth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the various sweets and painted glories<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature's wardrobe, which were all eclips'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By her diviner beauty. But alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What boots the former happiness I had,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> These lines seem a parody on the following one in
"Bonduca," by Beaumont and Fletcher, act iv. sc. 3&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Lie lightly on my ashes, gentle earth.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The time when Prior wrote his beautiful Ode to the
Memory of Colonel George Villiers, drowned in the river
Piave, in Friuli, 1703, is so near the period in which Mr
Pope composed his elegy to the memory of an unfortunate
lady, that it is difficult to say which of these great men
borrowed from the other. It appears certain, however, that
one of them, in the following lines, was indebted to his
friend, unless it can be supposed that both of them were
obliged to the above line of Beaumont and Fletcher. Prior
says&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lay the dead hero graceful in a grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The only honour he can now receive),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fragrant mould upon his body throw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plant the warrior laurel o'er his brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Light lie the earth</i>, and flourish green the bough."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Mr Pope writes thus&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What though no sacred earth allow thee room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy green turf <i>lie lightly on thy breast</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
I know not why we should suppose that Pope borrowed
from Prior, or that either of them was indebted to Beaumont
and Fletcher on this occasion. <i>Sit tibi terra levis!</i> is
a wish expressed in many of the ancient Roman inscriptions.
So in that on Pylades&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dicite qui legitis, <i>solito de more</i>, sepulto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pro meritis, Pylade, <i>sit tibi terra levis</i>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Again, in the sepulchral dialogue supposed to pass between
Atimetus and Homon&oelig;a&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Sit tibi terra levis</i>, mulier dignissima vita!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Again, in Propertius, El. xvii. lib. 1&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et mihi <i>non ullo pondere terra</i> foret."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Again, in Ovid&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et sit <i>humus cineri non onerosa</i> tuo!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Thus also Juvenal, Sat. vii.&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Di majorum umbris <i>tenuem et sine pondere terram</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spirantesque crocos, et in urna perpetuum ver!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Again, in Persius, Sat. i.&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Non <i>levior cippus nunc imprimit ossa</i>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... nunc non e manibus illis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nunc non e tumulo fortunataque favilla<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nascentur viol&aelig;?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
On the contrary, <i>Sit tibi terra gravis</i> and <i>Urgeat ossa lapis</i>
were usual maledictions, the ancients supposing that the
soul remained for some time after death with the body, and
was partner in its confinement. The latter of these wishes
is ludicrously adopted by Dr Evans, in his epitaph on Sir J.
Vanbrugh&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Lie heavy on him, earth!</i> for he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid many a heavy weight on thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
It may be observed that such ideas, however poetical,
have no great degree of propriety when introduced into
Christian elegies, as we have no belief that the soul is in
danger of being oppressed by a monument or stifled in a
grave.&mdash;<i>Steevens.</i></p></div>

<p>This writer is ranked by the editors of the "Biographia
Dramatica" in the third class of dramatic writers, and
Mr Gifford justly observes it is impossible to place him
higher. [Mr Collier, in a note to Rowley's "Match at
Midnight," 1633, Introd., supposed that Samuel Rowley,
the writer of the historical play on "Henry VIII.,"
1605, might be the "Master Rowley, once a rare scholar
of Pembroke Hall," mentioned by Meres ("Politeuphuia,"
1598, "Anc. Crit. Essays," iii. 154), as one of
the best for comedy; but Meres, who was himself a
university man, would scarcely confound either Samuel
or William Rowley with the <i>Ralph</i> Rowley of Pembroke
Hall, writer of certain occasional poetry now forgotten
(Cooper's "Athen&aelig;," ii. 388); and it is grossly improbable,
surely, that Meres should cite Ralph Rowley as
"one of the best for comedy" on the strength of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>pieces as are connected with Samuel Rowley's name.
Mr Collier remarks, that it appears from Henslowe's
memoranda ("Diary," pp. 120, 218) that "in the very
year in which Meres wrote, [Samuel Rowley] was
reduced to accept the situation of a hireling at Henslowe's
theatre." There is no trace of anything
written by him earlier than Jan. 7, 1601-2, when
he assisted William Haughton and William Borne in
writing a piece called "Judas." As to William, he
could scarcely have acquired any reputation so early,
and what, on the whole, is most likely to have been
the truth is, that Ralph Rowley composed pieces which,
like those of the Earl of Oxford and others, have not
survived.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Of the time or place of his birth, or decease,
we are altogether ignorant. Of his life it is only known
that he was a player. That he lived on terms of intimacy
with the dramatic writers of his time is sufficiently
evident from his having written in conjunction with
many of them; and, if we may believe the title-page,
[which we cannot, we should be able to believe that] in
one<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> he received assistance from Shakespeare himself.
He was a comedian, and one of the Prince's company
of players; and Oldys observes, in his MSS. notes
to Langbaine, on the authority of [transcripts made
by Vertue from] the office books of Lord Harrington,
Treasurer of the Chambers in those years, that
"One William Rowley was head of the Prince's company
of comedians from 1613 to 1616:" this, there can
be [no] doubt, was our author; and [he continued to belong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>to that company till the death of James I.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>] The
tragedy of "All's Lost by Lust" (as it is better known)
would perhaps have been selected in preference, but for
the resemblance it bears, in <i>the general outline</i>, to the
"Women beware Women" of Middleton, and the "Appius
and Virginia" of Webster,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to either of which, in my
opinion, it is inferior. On the present play Langbaine
observes that the passage of the widow's finding her wedding-ring,
which she dropped in crossing the Thames, in
the belly of a fish which her maid bought accidently in
the market, is founded either upon the story of Polycrates
of Samos, as the author may read at large in Herodotus,
lib. 3, <i>sive Thalia; or upon the like story related</i>
<i>of one Anderson of Newcastle, by Doctor Fuller, in his</i>
<i>"Worthies of England."</i> The story here referred to is
this: "A citizen of Newcastle (whose name I take to
be M. Anderson) talking with a friend of his upon
Newcastle bridge, and fingering his ring, before he was
aware let it fall into the river; and was much troubled
with the losse of it, till by a fish caught in the river
that losse was repaired, and his ring restored to him."
It is quite impossible, however, that our author could
have had this story from Fuller's "Worthies," which
was not published till many years after this drama was
in print: he might, however, have found it, whence
indeed Fuller himself took it (and the story of Polycrates
is likewise quoted there), in the Preface to a
little work called "Vox Piscis, or the Book-Fish, containing
three Treatises, which were found in the belly
of a Cod-fish in Cambridge Market, on Midsummer Eve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>last, Anno Domini 1626;" published in London in 1627.
It is not noticed either by Langbaine or the editors of
the "Biographia Dramatica" that this play is, in part,
historical. This, however, is the case; and I have
collected together, from various scattered notices in
Stow and Strype, the best account I was enabled of
Stephen Foster, his wife, and Alderman Brewen,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> three
of the principal persons in the drama. Sir Stephen
Foster was the son of Robert Foster of London, stock-fishmonger;
he was elected Sheriff of London in the
year 1444, and Lord Mayor in 1454, and served as
member for that city in the parliament held at Westminster
in the thirteenth of Henry VI. Speaking of
Ludgate, Strype says, (Append, p. 26), "There happened
to be prisoner there, one Stephen Foster, who
(as poor men are at this day) was a cryer at the grate, to
beg the benevolent charities of pious and commiserate
benefactors that passed by. As he was doing his doleful
office, a rich widow of London hearing his complaint,
enquired of him what would release him? To which
he answered, Twenty pound; which she in charity expended;
and clearing him out of prison, entertained
him in her service; who, afterward falling into the way
of merchandise, and increasing as well in wealth as
courage, wooed his mistress, Dame Agnes, and married
her.</p>

<p>"Her riches and his industry brought him both great
wealth and honour, being afterwards no less than Sir
Stephen Foster, Lord Mayor of the honourable city of
London: yet whilst he lived in this great honour and
dignity, he forgot not the place of his captivity; but,
mindful of the sad and irksome place wherein poor men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>were imprisoned, bethought himself of enlarging it, to
make it a little more delightful and pleasant for those
who in aftertimes should be imprisoned and shut up
therein. And, in order thereunto, acquainted his lady
with this his pious purpose and intention, in whom
likewise he found so affable and willing a mind to do
good to the poor, that she promised to expend as much
as he should do for the carrying on of the work; and,
having possessions adjoining thereunto, they caused to
be erected and built the rooms and places following,
that is to say, the paper house, the porch, the watch-hall,
the upper and lower lumbries, the cellar, the long
ward, and the chapel for divine service; in which
chapel is an inscription upon the wall, containing these
words&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>This chapel was erected and ordained for the divine</i>
<i>worship and service of God, by the Right Honourable Sir</i>
<i>Stephen Foster, Knight, some time Lord Maior of this</i>
<i>honourable city, and by Dame Agnes his wife, for the use</i>
<i>and godly exercise of the prisoners in this prison of</i>
<i>Ludgate, Anno 1454.</i></p>

<p>" ... He likewise gave maintenance for a preaching
minister," ... and "ordained what he had so built, with
that little which was before, should be free for all free-men,
and that they providing their own bedding should
pay nothing at their departure for lodging or chamber-rent."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>There can be little doubt from the inscription in the
chapel, that this worthy man was alive in the year
1454; it is still more certain from the following extract
from Stow, that he was dead in 1463: "In the year
1463, the third of Edward the Fourth, Mathew Philip
being mayor, in a common counsaile, at the request of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>the well-disposed, blessed, and devout woman, Dame
Agnes Foster, <i>widow</i>, late wife to Stephen Foster, fishmonger,
sometime mayor, for the comfort and reliefe of
all the poore prisoners, certaine articles were established.
<i>In primis</i>, that the new works then late edified by the
same Dame Agnes, for the inlarging of the prison of
Ludgate, from thenceforth should be had and taken as
a parte and parcell of the saide prison of Ludgate, so
that both the old and new works of Ludgate aforesaid,
be one prison, gaile, keeping, and charge for evermore."
To this Stow adds, "The said quadrant strongly builded
of stone, by the fore-named Stephen Foster, and Agnes
his wife, contayneth a large walking-place by ground, ...
the like roome it hath over it for lodgings, and over all
a fayre leades to walke upon, well imbattayled, all for
ease of prisoners, to the ende they shoulde have lodging
and water free without charge: as by certaine verses
grauen in copper, and fixed on the said quadrant, I have
read in forme following&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Deuout soules that passe this way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">for Stephen Foster late mayor, hartely pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dame Agnes his spouse, to God consecrate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">that of pitty this house made for L&#x014D;doners in Ludgate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that for lodging and water prisoners here nought pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">as there keepers shall answere at dreadfull domes day.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This plate, and one other of his armes, taken downe
with the old gate, I caused to be fixed over the entrie of
the said quadrant, but the verses being unhappily turned
inward to the wall, the like in effect is graven outward
in prose, declaring him to be a fishmonger, because
some upon a light occasion (as a maydens heade in a
glasse window) had <i>fabuled</i> him to bee a mercer, and
to <i>have begged there</i> at Ludgate." "They were both
buried (Stow, p. 163, edit. 1598) at Butolph's church,
Billingsgate." How far the poet has deviated from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
tradition as recorded by Strype, the reader will be now
as well able to decide as myself: when I speak of <i>the</i>
<i>tradition</i>, I allude only to the circumstance of his having
been confined a prisoner in Ludgate, and to his
release by his wife (by his <i>nephew</i> according to the
drama); and this I do on the authority of Stow, the
elder of the historians who, in his concluding remarks,
refers to it as a fable. Of the charitable acts of these
worthy people there can be no doubt. In relation to
the character of Bruin, I find (Strype, ii. 260) that
"In the year 1197, Walter Brune, a citizen of London,
and Rosia his wife, founded the hospital of Our Lady,
called Domus Dei, or St Mary the Spittle, without
Bishopsgate in London, an house of such relief to the
needy, that there was found standing at the surrender
thereof nine score beds well furnished for receipt of
poor people." The reader cannot fail to notice the
gross anachronisms with which the plot of this drama
abounds; something, however, may be said in excuse
of the bringing together such men as Foster and Bruin;
but the introduction of Henry III. is so wanton and
unnecessary, that there can be little doubt it is an error
of the printer's, and that Henry VI. is the character
intended, in whose time Sir Stephen Foster lived. I
did not, however, think it necessary to disturb the text;
not out of respect to the quarto, for a more disgraceful
work never issued from the press even of the printers
of that age, but because, the circumstance having been
once noticed, it becomes of little consequence. While
on this subject I may just observe, that in the original
this play is, with very trifling limitations, throughout
printed as blank verse: by what possible rule or ear
the division was made it is absolutely impossible to
conceive; some scenes have without hesitation been
reduced to prose; and by changing the construction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
whole speeches, innumerable couplets have been restored:
if yet the attentive reader shall discover passages
(and that many have escaped my notice I cannot
doubt), on which he would willingly exercise his skill,
I can only observe that he must not make too free with
the pruning knife; that it is difficult to distinguish
between a licentious metre and measured prose; and
that very little good dramatic dialogue of the higher
walks can be found, that, with moderate torturing to
the eye and ear, may not pass for such metre.</p>

there's pricks in holly; or if you fear not the

the pricks without the wands: you give away
the sword, and must defend yourself with the

promise her fair&mdash;she's apt to believe a young

matter: 'tis charity. Twenty to one some rich
miser raked it together. This is none of Hercules'
labours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steph.</span> Ha? Let me recount these articles:
<i>seek her out; promise her fair; marry her; let her</i>
<i>estate fly</i>. But where should I find her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> The easiest of all. Why, man, they are
more common than tavern-bushes; two fairs
might be furnished every week in London with
'em, though no foreigners came in, if the charter
were granted once: nay, 'tis thought, if the horsemarket
be removed, that Smithfield shall be so
employed; and then, I'll warrant you, 'twill be as
well furnished with widows as 'twas with sows,
cows, and old trotting jades before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steph.</span> 'Sfoot! if it were, I would be a chapman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
I'd see for my pleasure, and buy for my
<i>love</i>, for <i>money</i> I have none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid</span>. Thou shalt not stay the market, if thou'lt
be ruled. I'll find thee out a widow, and help in
some of the rest too, if thou'lt but promise me the
last, but to let her estate fly; for she's one I love
not, and I'd be glad to see that revenge on her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steph</span>. Spend her estate? were't five aldermen's.
I'll put you in security for that; 'sfoot!
all my neighbours shall be bound for me; nay,
my kind sister-in-law shall pass her word for
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid</span>. Only this I'll enjoin you: to be matrimonially
honest to her for your own health's
sake. All other injuries shall be blessings to
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steph</span>. I'll bless her, then; I ever drank so
much, that I was never great feeder. Give me
drink and my pleasure, and a little flesh serves my
turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid</span>. I'll show thee the party. What sayest
thou to myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steph</span>. Yourself, gentlewoman? I would it
were no worse. I have heard you reputed a

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_64_64" id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> Stephen puns on the words <i>bale</i> and <i>bail</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> It appears from an after-remark of Stephen's, that the
game they were playing at was <i>passage</i>. <i>Boreas</i> may be a
punning invocation to the north wind to assist him in his
<i>passage</i>, or an allusion to the noise which arises at the same
time in the bowling-alley.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> The <i>trundletail</i> was a species of dog in little estimation,
I believe; it is mentioned in the "Lear" of Shakespeare.
So Ursula to Quar. in "Bartholomew Fair:" "Do you sneer,
you dog's-head, you <i>trundletail</i>!" But here the host only
puns on the rolling or trundling the bowl at the game.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> The host was probably box-keeper or groom-porter; and
it appears by an extract from the <i>Monthly Mirror</i> (quoted by
Mr Gifford), that "if the caster throws three mains, or wins
by throwing three times successively, he pays to the box-keeper,
for the use of the house, a stipulated sum." It was
probably these profits that the host directs them to look to;
or that in our poet's time, or at a different game, a regular
percentage might have been paid to the box-keeper on the
money staked; or the host might have been banker, and
staked against the players, as now at Rouge-et-Noir, and
some other games, I believe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> It is perhaps unnecessary to notice that Stephen puns
between the <i>quatre</i> and <i>trey</i> on the dice, and the <i>cater</i> or
<i>caterer</i> who buys the provisions, and the <i>tray</i> in which it is
brought home.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> Stephen means, perhaps, that but one shilling was left
of the forty his nephew had supplied him with.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> <i>Fullam</i> or Fulham was a well-known name for false dice.
One of the cheats therefore sneeringly asks if one of the dice
was Fulham, which of them was Putney, as Putney is on the
Thames immediately opposite to Fulham.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> Robert puns on the word <i>tester</i>, which signifies the cover
of a bed as well as a sixpence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> There was formerly a prison at Moorgate as well as at
Ludgate; though Stephen means, I conceive, that the next
time she would see him would be when attracted to that
spot to see <i>the operation of ducking performed on her as a</i>
<i>scold</i>. The ditch, as appears from Stow, was called <i>deep</i>
<i>ditch</i>; but whether celebrated for exhibitions of this nature
or not, I cannot say. It is mentioned in the "First Part of
Henry IV."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> That a <i>wisp</i> was in some way made use of for the punishment
or exposure of a scold, is evident from the notes on a
passage in the "Third Part of Henry VI.," ii. 2. From the
verses quoted by Malone, it seems probable that the wearing
of the wisp was in some way connected with, or made part
of, the ceremony of the skimmington. [See "Popular Antiquities
of Great Britain," ii, 128.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> The clown alludes to the <i>then</i> manner of choosing the
king and queen on Twelfth Day, which was as follows.
With the ingredients of which the cake or cakes, for there
was probably one for each sex, were composed, a <i>bean</i> and
<i>pea</i> were mixed up, and the two persons who were so fortunate
as to find these in their respective portions were declared
king and queen for the night. Thus in Herrick's "Hesperides"&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Now, now, the mirth comes.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With the cake fall of plums,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Besides we must know,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The <i>pea</i> also<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Must revel, <i>as queen</i>, in the court here."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
This method of election, which we find referred to as early
as Edward III., was common at the beginning of the sixteenth
century to both our universities. The curious reader will
collect further information on the subject from ["Popular
Antiquities of Great Britain," 1870, i. 13 <i>et seq.</i>]</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> 'Tis good ware, believe me, sir: I know
that by mine own experience, for I have handled
the like many times in my first wife's days. Ay,
by knighthood! sometimes before I was married,
too; therefore I know't by mine own experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> Well, sir, I know by observation as much
as you do by experience; for I have known many
gentlemen have taken up such ware as this is, but
it has lain on their hands as long as they lived.
This I have seen by observation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] I am like to have a couple of
fair chapmen. If they were at my own dispose, I
would willingly raffle them both at twelvepence a
share. They would be good food for a new plantation.
The one might mend his experience, and
the other his observation very much.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> Sir, let me advise you; I see you want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>experience. Meddle no further in this case;
'twill be the more credit for your observation, for
I find by my experience you are but shallow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> But shallow, sir? Your experience is a
little wide; you shall find I will be as deep in this
case as yourself. My observation has been where
your experience must wait at door; yet I will give
you the fore-horse place, and I will be in the
thills<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, because you are the elder tree, and I the
young plant. Put on your experience, and I will
observe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> Sweet virgin, to be prolix and tedious
fits not experience. Short words and large deeds
are best pleasing to women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> So, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> My name is Speedwell by my father's
copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Then you never served for't, it seems<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> Yes, sweet feminine! I have served
for it too; for I found my nativity suited to my
name. As my name is Speedwell, so have I sped
well in divers actions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> It must needs be a fair and comely suit,
then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> You observe very well, sweet virgin;
for his nativity is his doublet, which is the upper
part of his suit; and his name is in's breeches,
for that part, which is his name, he defiles many
times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> Your observation is corrupt, sir. Let
me show mine own tale. I say, sweet beauty, my
name is Speedwell. My godfather, by his bounty
(being an old soldier, and having served in the wars
as far as Boulogne) therefore called my name Godfrey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>a title of large renown.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> My wealth and wit
has added to those the paraphrase of knighthood,
so that my name in the full longitude is called
Sir Godfrey Speedwell, a name of good experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> If every quality you have be as large in
relation as your name, sir, I should imagine the
best of them, rather than hear them reported.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> You say well, sweet modesty; a good
imagination is good, and shows your good experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> Nay, if names can do any good, I beseech
you observe mine. My name is Lambskin, a thing
both hot and harmless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> On, sir; I would not interrupt you,
because you should be brief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> My godfather, seeing in my face some
notes of disposition, in my cradle did give me the
title of Innocent,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> which I have practised all my
lifetime; and since my father's decease, my wealth
has purchased me in the vanguard of my name the
paraphrase of gentility, so that I am called <i>Master</i>
Innocent Lambskin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> In good time: and what trade was your
father, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> My father was of an occupation before
he was a tradesman; for, as I have observed in my
father's and mother's report, they set up together
in their youth. My father was a starch-maker,
and my mother a laundress; so, being partners,
they did occupy<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> long together before they were
married; then was I born.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> What, before your father was married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> Truly a little after. I was the first-fruits,
as they say. Then did my father change his copy,
and set up a brewhouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Ay, then came your wealth in, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> Your observation's good. I have carried
the tallies<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> at my girdle seven year together with
much delight and observation, for I did ever love
to deal honestly in the nick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> A very innocent resolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> Your experience may see his coarse education;
but to the purpose, sweet female. I do
love that face of yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Sir, if you love nothing but my face, I
cannot sell it from the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> You may see his slender observation.
Sweet virgin, I do love your lower parts better
than your face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> Sir, you do interrupt and thwart my
love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> Ay, sir, I am your rival, and I will
thwart your love; for your love licks at the face,
and my love shall be arsy-versy to yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> I would desire no better wooing of so
bad suitors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steph.</span> Mistake me not, kind-heart.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> In loving your face, I love all the rest
of your body, as you shall find by experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> Well, sir, you love me, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> Let your experience make a trial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> No, sir, I'll believe you rather, and I
thank you for't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> I love you too, fair maid, double and
treble, if it please you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> I thank you too, sir; I am so much beholding
to you both, I am afraid I shall never requite
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> Requite <i>one</i>, sweet chastity, and let it be
Sir Godfrey, with the correspondency of your love
to him. I will maintain you like a lady; and it is
brave, as I know by experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span> I will maintain you like a gentlewoman:
and that may be better maintenance than a lady's,
as I have found by observation.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> How dare you maintain that, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Speed.</span> I dare cross it with my sword, sir.</p></div>

<p class="directright">[<i>Lays his hand on his sword.</i><br /></p>

call you 'em? I'd keep dish-water continually
boiling, but I'd seethe such suitors: I have had
much ado to keep 'em from bloodshed. I have
seen for all the world a couple of cowardly curs
quarrel in that fashion; as the one turns his head,
the other snaps behind; and as he turns, his
mouth recoils again: but I thank my pains for't, I
have leagued with 'em for a week without any further
intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brew.</span> Well, daughter, well; say a third

indeed I would learn to number no farther, if
there was a good account made of that.</p>

I'll make you yield, if I can.</p>

this yourself: and, Jane, use him kindly; he shall

him kindly, it shall be for something I like in himself,

attended fairs. In 1592 Chettle printed his tract called
"Kindhart's Dream." Dilke observes: "I am inclined to
think, however, that <i>kind-heart</i> was the '<i>travelling name</i>' of
some notorious quack tooth-drawer, or a cant name given
to the whole race of them. So the stage-keeper, in the induction
to 'Bartholomew Fair,' when expressing his fear of
the author's success, says: 'He has ne'er a sword-and-buckler
man in his fair, nor a little Davy, to take toll of the bawds
there, as in my time; nor a <i>kind-heart, if anybody's teeth</i>
<i>should chance to ake in his play</i>.' And further, it is part
of the 'covenant and agreement,' in the same induction,
that the audience shall not 'look back to the sword-and-buckler
age of Smithfield, but content themselves with the
present. Instead of a little Davy, to take toll of the bawds,
the author doth promise a strutting horse-courser, with a
leer drunkard, two or three to attend him in as good equipage
as you would wish. <i>And then for kind-heart the tooth-drawer</i>,
a fine oily pig-woman, with,'" &amp;c., &amp;c. [Lambskin's

"This art," says Steevens, in a note on that passage, "is
pretended to be taught at the end of some of the old books
that treat of cookery." As I understand the passage then,
Jane means to say, <i>I have such good qualities and beauty as</i>
<i>nature has given, but none that are produced by art</i>. If the
passage be thus understood, the opposition of the <i>rose</i> and
the <i>gilliflower</i> is complete. If the reader is not satisfied
with this conjecture, I will further suggest that <i>gill-flirt</i> was
then a well-known term for a wanton; and Steevens has
informed us that <i>gilly'vors</i> (the vulgar way of calling gilly-flowers)
is still in use in Sussex to denote a <i>harlot</i>. Jane
has spoken more than once of her <i>honesty</i>, and here may be
the allusion.</p></div>

As I had occasion to give a note here, I thought one sample
of the original might gratify the reader's curiosity, and he
<i>has a miniature of the whole work</i>. The poet, who is here
very minute in the description of Stephen's charity, is justified
by the inscription on the wall quoted by Stow. On this
subject, however, Strype observes, "The water <i>I find not to be</i>
<i>altogether his gift</i>; for that I perused lately a book, wherein
I found a memorandum, that Sir Robert Knowles [Lord
Mayor in 1400] gave maintenance for the supply of the
prisoners of <i>Ludgate</i> and Newgate for ever" ("Appendix,"
p. 26). There can be little doubt, however, that this excellent
man did something for the benefit of the prisoners, in regard
to the supplying them with water.&mdash;<i>Dilke.</i></p></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>William Cartwright was, according to Lloyd,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> born
the 16th of August 1615, though Wood<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> says he was
born at Northway, near Tewksbury, Gloucestershire, in
September 1611, and christened on the 26th of the same
month. There is as much difference between these two
writers, with respect to his father, as there is concerning
the time of his birth. Lloyd says he was the son
of Thomas Cartwright of Burford, in Oxfordshire.
Wood asserts that his father's name was William Cartwright,
one who had dissipated a fair inheritance, and
was at last reduced to keep an inn at Cirencester.
These contradictory accounts are totally irreconcilable.
Wood's, however, is probably the true one.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> That
author says that Cartwright received part of his education
under Mr William Top, master of the Free School
at Cirencester; was from thence sent to Westminster,
where he completed his education under Mr Lambert
Osbaldiston; and in the year 1628<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> was chosen a student
of Christ Church in Oxford, and placed under the
care of Mr Terrent. He took his several degrees of
Bachelor and Master of Arts&mdash;the latter in 1635; and
afterwards entering into holy orders, became, as Wood<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>expresses it, "the most florid and seraphical preacher
in the University." In October 1642, Bishop Duppa
conferred on him the place of Succentor in the Church
of Salisbury; and on the 12th of April 1643, he was
admitted junior proctor of the University. He died
the 29th of November following of a malignant fever,
universally lamented by every person who knew him,
even by his sovereign, who showed him particular
marks of his respect.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> He was buried at the upper end
of the south aisle, adjoining to the choir of the cathedral
of Christ Church. "He was," says Langbaine,
"extremely remarkable both for his outward and
inward endowments, his body being as handsome as his
soul. He was an expert linguist, understanding not
only Greek and Latin, but French and Italian, as perfectly
as his mother tongue. He was an excellent
orator, and yet an admirable poet, a quality which
Cicero, with all his pains, could not attain to. Nor
was Aristotle less known to him than Cicero and
Virgil; and those who heard his metaphysical lectures
gave him the preference to all his predecessors, the
present Bishop of Lincoln (Dr Barlow) excepted. His
sermons were as much admired as his other composures;
and one fitly applied to our author that
saying of Aristotle concerning &AElig;schrion the poet, <i>that</i>
<i>he could not tell what &AElig;schrion could not do</i>."</p>

<p>Ben Jonson said of him with some passion, <i>My son</i>
<i>Cartwright writes all like a man</i>; and Dr Fell, Bishop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>of Oxford, gave him this character: <i>Cartwright was</i>
<i>the utmost man could come to</i>.</p>

<p>Besides a sermon and some Greek and Latin poems, he
was the author of four plays, one only of which, I
believe, was published in his lifetime, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>1. "The Royal Slave, a Tragi-Comedy, presented to
the king and queen by the students of Christ Church in
Oxford, August 30, 1636; presented since to both their
majesties, at Hampton Court, by the king's servants."
4<sup>o</sup>, 1639-40; 8vo, 1651.</p>

<p>This play, in which the celebrated Dr Busby performed
a part, gave so much satisfaction to their
majesties, that it was by their orders performed at
Hampton Court by their own servants. Langbaine
says the preference was given to the representation by
the collegians, as much superior to that of the players.</p>

<p>2. "The Lady Errant, a Tragi-Comedy."</p>

<p>3. "The Ordinary, a comedy," [probably written in
1634.]</p>

<p>4. "The Siege; or, Love's Convert, a Tragi-Comedy."</p>

such a subject.</p></div></div>

Johannes Trithemius, abb&egrave; of the order of St Benedict,
and one of the most learned men of the fifteenth century,
was born at Tritenheim, in the diocese of Treves, the 1st of
February 1462. After having studied for some time, he became
a Benedictine friar, and abbot of Spanheim, in the
diocese of Mayence, in 1483. He governed the abbey until
the year 1506, when he joined the abbey of St James, at
Wurtzburgh. He was learned in all sciences, divine and
human, and died the 13th of December 1516.
</p>
<p>
Thevet calls him a <i>subtle philosopher, an ingenious mathematician,</i>
<i>a famous poet, an accomplished historian, a very</i>
<i>eloquent orator, and eminent divine</i>. Naudius says that those
who would make him a magician ground their right on a
little book of three or four sheets, printed in 1612, entitled,
"Veterum Sophorum sigilla et imagines magic&aelig;, sive
sculptura lapidum aut gemmarum ex nomine Tetragrammaton
cum signatura planetarum authoribus Zoroastre, Salomone
Raphaele, Chaele Hermete Thelete, ex Joan Kithemii
manuscripto erut&aelig;." Secondly, his speaking so pertinently
of magic, and giving himself the title of magician in some of
his epistles. Thirdly, his writing the book of Steganography,
a treatise stuffed with the names of devils, and full of invocations,
and as very pernicious condemned by Boville as
worse than Agrippa. To these Naudius answers that the
pamphlet of making images and characters upon stones,
under certain constellations, is a pure imposture and cheat
of booksellers, it being printed above 120 years before by
Camillus Lienard, as the third book of his "Mirror of Precious
Stones, De Unguento Armario." From a letter then to
a Carmelite of Gaunt, Arnoldus Bostius, the suspicion of his
being a magician must be collected, wherein he specified
many miraculous and extraordinary effects performed in his
treatise of Steganography. This, however, is defended by
several writers only as the means to decipher.&mdash;Naudius's
"History of Magick," translated by Davies, p. 237, &amp;c.</p></div>

whose sufferings by imprisonment and torture at Malaga,

1614; reprinted in 1616, &amp;c., with additions. At the conclusion
of this work he says, "Here is the just relation of

supposed to have travelled more miles on foot than any
person of his times, or indeed in any period since. From
his writings, and many parts of his conduct, he cannot be
supposed to have been in his perfect senses. He was, notwithstanding,
a man of considerable learning, and rendered
himself ridiculous, chiefly by dwelling with too much attention
on the trifling accidents which happened to him during
his journey. In the year 1608 he left England and went to
Venice and back again; a journey performed on foot in
five months. On his return, he published an account of it
in a large quarto volume, 1611, containing 655 pages, besides
more than 100 filled with commendatory verses by Ben
Jonson and other wits of the age, who both laughed at and
flattered him at the same time. He afterwards travelled
into Persia, and from thence into the East Indies (still on
foot), and died at Surat in the year 1617.</p></div>

1591, p. 11, says: "In Russia they have divers
kinds of fish, very good and delicate: as the Bellouga or
Bellougina, of four or five elnes long; the Ostrina or Sturgeon,
but not so thicke nor long. These four kinds of fish
breed in the Volgha, and are catched in great plenty, and
served thence into the whole realme for a great food. Of
the roes of these foure kinds, they make very great store of

The introduction of these foreign delicacies is ridiculed

Revels," act iii. sc. 1: "Come; let us go and taste some
light dinner, a dish of sliced <i>caviare</i>, or so."

The compositor's eye might have caught <i>had not</i> from the
following line&mdash;a very common accident. Without this
emendation we have too much of <i>not</i> and <i>had not</i> in the
course of three verses.&mdash;<i>Steevens's note</i> (<i>altered</i>.) [Cartwright
and Digby probably derived the story of the Ethiop
mother and her white offspring from a common source; but
Digby's work was not published till several years after Cartwright's
death.]</p></div>

decayed coffins, and in more ancient times were consecrated
at the ceremony of <i>creeping [to] the cross</i>, of which an account
is given in a note on the "Merry Devil of Edmonton,"
with reference to the observations of Dr Percy on the
"Northumberland Household Book," 1512.&mdash;<i>Steevens.</i>
</p>
<p>
Cramp-rings were formerly worn as charms for curing of
the cramp. See Brookes's "Natural History," vol. i. p. 206.&mdash;<i>Pegge.</i>
</p>
<p>
Andrew Borde, in his "Book of the Introduction of Knowledge,"
1542, says: "The kynges of Englande ... doth
halowe every yere <i>crampe rynges</i>, the which rynges worne on
ones fynger doth helpe them the whyche hath the crampe."
Dr Percy, in his notes on the "Northumberland Household
Book," speaking of these rings observes "that our ancient
kings even in those dark times of superstition, do not seem to
have affected to cure the king's evil; at least in the MSS. above
quoted there is no mention or hint of any power of that sort.
This miraculous gift was left to be claimed by the Stuarts:
our ancient Plantagenets were humbly content to cure the
<i>cramp</i>." I cite this passage merely to remark that the
learned editor of the above curious volume has been betrayed
into a mistake by the manner in which the <i>cramp</i>
<i>rings</i> are mentioned in Mr Anstis's MSS. The power of
curing the king's evil was certainly claimed by many of the
Plantagenets. The above Dr Borde, who wrote in the time
of Henry VIII., says, "The kynges of England, by the
power that God hath given to them, doth make sicke men
whole of a sickness called the <i>Kynges Evyll</i>." In Laneham's
"Account of the Entertainment of Kennilworth Castle," it
is said, "And also by her highness accustomed mercy and
charitee, nyne cured of the paynful and dangerous diseaz
called the <i>King's Evil</i>, for that kings and queens of this
realm withoout oother medsin (save only by handling and
prayer) only doo cure it." Polydore Virgil asserts the same,
and William Tooker, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, [1597,]
published a book on this subject. For the knowledge of
this last book I am obliged to Dr Douglas's excellent treatise,
called "The Criterion," p. 191, &amp;c.</p></div>

reign of King James I.; a person who had been one
of the opponents of Parsons the Jesuit, in defence of the
Reformed Religion. In the year 1616 he procured an Act
of Parliament for incorporating himself and other divines to
be provost and fellows of a college then founded at Chelsea,
for promoting the study of polemic divinity, and vindicating
the doctrines of the Reformation against all Popish writers.
To carry this design into execution, he settled on the college
four farms in Devonshire, of the value of &pound;300 per
annum, and the benefit of an extent on a statute, acknowledged
by Sir Lewis Stukely, for &pound;4000. By the Act of
Parliament, the college was empowered to bring a stream of
water from the river Lee for the use of the city of London
a scheme similar to that then lately executed by Sir Hugh
Middleton. This foundation, although patronised both by
King James and his sons, Prince Henry and Charles I.,
yet fell to decay. One range of building only, scarce an
eighth of the intended edifice, was erected by Dr Sutcliff, at
the expense of &pound;3000. After lingering some time, suits
were commenced about the title to the very ground on
which the college stood, and by a decree of the Court of
Chancery, in the time of Lord Coventry, three of the four
farms were returned to Dr Sutcliff's heir. See "The Glory
of Chelsey Colledge Revived," by John Darly, 4<sup>o</sup>, 1662.
<i>Sutcliff's wit</i> seems almost to have been proverbial. Beaumont,
in his letter to Ben Jonson, says&mdash;

<p>
So in "Bartholomew Fair," act iii. sc. 6: "Cry you

<p>
In Marmyon's "Fine Companion," act iv. sc. 1: "He come

<p>
Again, in Dekker's "Belman of London," 1608, sig. G 2:
"To bee up more earely then <i>a noyse of shrugging fidlers</i>."
</p>
<p>
And in "Miscellaneous State Papers from 1501 to 1726,"
vol. i. p. 87: "After the which they had a very notable
banquet; the heavenly <i>noise</i> that was there, as well with
strange instruments of music as otherwise, I cannot
declare."

who, on account of the severe censures of the Star Chamber,
the greatness of the fines there, the rigorous proceedings
to impose ceremonies, the suspending and silencing
ministers for not reading in church "The Book of Sports,"
and other grievances, sold their estates, and settled in <i>New</i>
<i>England</i>. The emigrations, on these accounts, at length
became so general, that a proclamation was put forth in
1635 to stop those who had determined to follow their
friends. It is remarkable that amongst those who were
actually on shipboard, and prevented by the proclamation
from proceeding on their voyage, were the patriot Hampden
and his cousin Oliver Cromwell.</p></div></div>

<h3><i>EDITION.</i></h3>


<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The London Chaunticleers. A Witty Comoedy, full of</i>
<i>Various and Delightfull Mirth. Often Acted with Great</i>
<i>applause, and never before Published. London, Printed</i>
<i>for Simon Miller, at the Star in St. Pauls Churchyard.</i>
1659. 4<sup>o</sup>.</p></div>

<p>This amusing and peculiar play has never hitherto
been re-published from the original edition. It is a performance,
as the title-page partly intimates, considerably
older than the date of publication. Mr Halliwell
("Dictionary of Old Plays," 1860, p. 144) observes:
"This piece is rather an interlude than a play; but it
is curious, the characters being London criers.</p>

<p>"From a passage in the prologue we may perhaps
infer that the production originally appeared during a
visitation of the plague at London, and that it was first
presented (the machinery required being simple enough)
on some suburban or provincial stage. The metropolis
was ravaged by pestilence in 1636, which is a not unlikely
date for the composition and original presentation
of 'The London Chanticleers.'"</p>

<p>The allusions to old usages, with the mention of many
well-known ballads, and of some known no longer,
contribute to give the present piece an interest and value
of its own.</p>

may be hanged at free cost? I'll go rob the
sheriff, and not leave him enough to hire an executioner
for me; steal the judge's gown, that he

that they may not bring me in guilty.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> Buy a save-all, buy a save-all; never more
need. Come, buy a save-all! Buy a comb-brush
or a pot-brush; buy a flint, or a steel, or a tinder-box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> O Bristle, welcome! I perceive by thy
merry note, that there's music in thy pocket.
What, dost jingle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> And I perceive by thy heavy countenance
thy purse is light. Dost want coin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> Dost thou doubt that? Dost thou not
see I'm sober? Do I swear or kick for asking, if
I want money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> These are infallible signs indeed that thou
dost want it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> I have been up this two hours, and
have not visited one alehouse yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> Nay, I am fully satisfied; but canst thou
want money whilst thou hast fingers to tell it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> Why, wouldst have 'um made of loadstones,
to draw all that comes nigh 'em?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> Canst thou be poor, and have a tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Nay, then, 'tis pity but thou shouldst be sent to
the Mint thyself, and be stamped into farthings, to
be bestowed on beggars! I'd dig to the Antipodes
with my nails, but I'd find a mine; and, like the
cripple, run up Paul's steeple, but I'd get the silver
cock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> He had no legs to break if he had fallen,
nor weight enough to crack his neck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> Nor thou wit enough to be hanged. Thou
hadst rather be starved than break open a cupboard,
and die a good poor man or an honest beggar,
than a rich thief or a gentleman rogue. Thou
thinkest it more commendable, I warrant, to be
carried in a chair from constable to constable, with
a warrant from the churchwardens; that thou art
a poor man, and desirest their charity; that
thou art willing to work, but art almost starved;
hast half a dozen children, the eldest not above
three years old, their mother having been dead
this eight year; and such pitiful complaints, with
as many tears as would drown all the victuals thou
eat'st, than ride a mile or two in a cart, with the
sheriff attending on thee! Thou believ'st that
more may be gotten with a <i>Good your</i> (non-sense)
<i>Worship</i> to every Jack than a <i>Sirrah, deliver your</i>
<i>purse</i> to the best lord i' th' land; and all this
grounded upon that precise axiom, "A little with
honesty is better than a great deal with knavery."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> Thanks, good Bristle, for thy counsel.
I mean to be as perfect a pickpocket, as good as
ever nipped the judge's bung while he was condemning
him. Look to thy purse, Bristle, lest I
practise on thee first. The fairies can't creep
through a lesser keyhole than I. O, for a dead
man's hand now! 'Tis as good as poppy-seed to
charm the house asleep; it makes 'um as senseless
as itself. Come, shall we turn knight-errants?
Name the first adventure. Dost thou know no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
enchanted castle, no golden ladies in distress or
imprisoned by some old giant usurer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> Stay a little, Heath. I have a design in
my head that will outgo Don Quixote or Palmerin
as far as they did the giants they overcame&mdash;a
trick that shall load us with money without any
fear of th' cart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> I'll be thy squire, though I fare no better
than Sanch Pancha, and am tossed in a blanket.</p>

Cupid's darts, hath pricked me to the heart!
Whiter than the curds thou sell'st, softer than the

<p><span class="smcap">Wel.</span> Ay, there's an honest soaker; the old

sleights of nicking and frothing he scorns as too
common, but supplies that defect with little jugs
and great glasses, and where he fears a dissolution,
brings up his flagon, begins the king's health, and
with that decoy draws on another dozen or two,
till the whole royal progeny is gone over. He
wished it once as numerous as old Priam's was,
and another time had like to have been hanged for
praying treason, that there were a hundred kings

their healths for fear of displeasing any.</p>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bung</span>.</p>

to part with it.</p>

please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wel.</span> No, no, I'll warm't myself, and it shall

that they must forfeit all their toes that have
no corns, or that they must never eat good victuals
that have not the toothache? Are red mufflers

as sure signs of the ache of teeth and toes as a
red lattice of an alehouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ditty.</span> No, truly, Master Gum, I have none of
these books, but I have as good. I have very
strange news from beyond seas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gum.</span> What is't? Do they want corn-cutters
or tooth-drawers? prythee, let's hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ditty.</span> The King of Morocco has got the black

for the Duke of Saxony, that is dead of the stone;
and Presbyter John is advanced to Zealand; the

<p><span class="smcap">Bud.</span> Well, I must strike whilst the iron's hot.
Good Vulcan, be assistant, and grant that some

bellows of rhetoric, blow the coals of good-will, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
with my forked arguments stir up the fire of affection
in her! I have been filing my nose and anviling
down my chin this two days, and yet just
now there was scarce room enough for her sweet
lips and mine to meet. She calls me Vulcan and
Cyclops, and says I shall be hanged up for the
sign of the <i>Black Boy</i>. But 'tis no matter. It
may be, when she calls me Vulcan, she would have
me make her my Venus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ditty.</span> Who is this trough that he is about to

<p><span class="smcap">Bud.</span> Well, I'll try both ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ditty.</span> How now, Budget? Can you sing your

<p><span class="smcap">Bud.</span> Not yet, Ditty; but is't to the tune o' th'

<p><span class="smcap">Ditty.</span> Ay, ay; but what makes you so pale,
Budget? There's a cup of ale at mine host Welcome's

<p><span class="smcap">Bud.</span> O Ditty, there is a nail knocked into my

<p><span class="smcap">Gum.</span> Why, if you can't wrench it out, we'll
send for a smith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ditty.</span> Has Cupid played the joiner with you,

that nail? What metal is she made of, that you

<p><span class="smcap">Gum.</span> I knew a bitch of that name was a very

as any porter in the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bud.</span> What, villain, do you make a puppy of
me! I'll kick you into glove-dogs, you mongrels,
hell-hounds, whelps! <span class="directline">[<i>Kicks them.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dit.</span> Good Budget, be pacified, and we'll recompense

<p><span class="smcap">Jen.</span> Well, Vamp, you know how to take the

<p><span class="smcap">Jen.</span> Such as shall be christened at Saint James'

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> No, no; two boys and so many wenches,
that we will furnish the whole city with herb-women
and costermongers of our own progeny;
there shall not be an apple-wife in the whole
country but she shall be ingrafted into some branch
of our family: not a day in the whole year shall
pass but some tree of our stock shall be set, till
we have enough to plant a wilderness and people
it. Go, pack up thy treasure; the time flies too
fast, but we'll outstrip it. To-night we'll be at a
place some ten miles off, where a house ready-furnished
waits for thee, with all things necessary for
the celebration of our nuptials. I'll fit thee with
a pair of shoes; let's see thy foot. It is of the

three hours' journey. Let me have thy bundles of

<p><span class="smcap">Curds.</span> I have been one in my days, when we

with dancing hard, we always went to the cushion
dance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> Ay, we'll have dancing at our wedding
too, when the cups of canary have made our heads
frisk. O, how we shall foot it, when we can scarce
stand, and caper when we are cut in the leg! The
first year shall be a leap-year with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curds.</span> What shall we have at our wedding
dinner? We'll be sure of a plum-pudding, that
shall be the very flower of the feast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> Then a leg of beef shall walk round the
table, like a city captain with a target of lamb
before it: a snipe, with his long bill, shall be a serjeant,

shalt be lady-general, and pick out the choicest of

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> What, did she melt easily? Was she
pliable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> O, like cobbler's wax; she stuck to my
fingers: I could hardly get her off, and had much
ado to persuade her not to undo herself quite.
She would have had me gone home and took all;
nay, would have robbed her aunt too, but that I
should cheat her sufficiently. This will be the
best day's work I have done this many a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> And yet all my rhetoric could scarce persuade
you to be wise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> I am thy scholar, and thou shalt find
I'll prove an apt one. If I am not as perfect at
the art as thyself in a short time, may I never be
made free, but always steal for others, and be
hanged myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> Yet still thou owest thy learning unto me;
if I had not been thy master, thou might'st have
sat at home now with a cup of cold water and thy
precious jewel, a contented mind, wishing thou
hadst but money enough to pay a forfeit for being
drunk, though thy empty pockets forced thee to
be sober.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> Come, prythee, leave; I myself do now
laugh at my former ignorance. Thou hast infused
a new soul into me; thou hast played hocus-pocus
with me, I think, and juggled Gusmond or country
Tom's legerdemain into me. There's not such a
change in all the Metamorphosis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> And now thou hast<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> bargained with thy

<p><span class="smcap">Heath.</span> Yes, a silver bodkin and thimble, and
as many curds as would serve the court ladies for
a twelvemonth, besides the box laden with all the
plate and household stuff that her pitchy fingers
could stick to in six years' service, with which I
believe she now waits for me at the appointed

Come, my sweeting; every minute was an age till

<p><span class="smcap">Jen.</span> Is there no danger of drowning? I am

drink thy health, till it spews and purges again,

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> Dolphins shall bring musicians on their
backs, and spout out cans of beer beyond the conduits
on the Mayor's-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jen.</span> We'll have a fish-dinner, too, and the Lady
o' th' Lobster shall be Mistress o' th' Feast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bris.</span> Yes, yes; and Triton's trumpet shall
echo up each mess, while we sound the bottom of
our ocean cups, and drown god Neptune in a sea
of wine! But let not your sister Nancy hear of it
for your ears. She'll raise a tempest will ship-wreck
all our hopes; she'll storm louder than the
winds. Meet me here two hours hence with all
your tacklings. I'll see this bundle shall be safe.

Is she softened, and will she now let me taste her
strawberry lips willingly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ditty.</span> Yes, and give you cream to 'um too.
Why, she is almost mad for you, and has bespoke
a place in Bedlam already. If you do not go
quickly and recover her, she'll either be turned
into a kettle with grief, or melt into bell-metal,
that she may be made a posnet of. Nay, and
desired me to tell you that if after her transformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
she chance ever to come under your hands
to be mended, she would desire you to use her
gently, and that you should know which was she,

no way to persuade her to live still a woman? I

have one with three legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ditty.</span> If you make haste, you may chance to
come before she is quite changed; you may save
a leg, perhaps, or an arm of flesh yet; but I believe

she had at the funeral of a dear friend, for whose

how would Cerberus take it, to see one come to
hell with a dog-skin pair of gloves? A silken
garter! This, I warrant it, she had at a wedding,

amongst our houses of good fellowship. How our
cans would rot and jugs grow musty for want
of use! I would the whole city were jugs and cans,
that they might never be in good case but when
they're full of good liquor. I fear this will be a
bad year for all of our profession; salt meats are
grown out of fashion, and Lent will be forgotten
this year, and, for aught I know, the next Papist

superstition because he uses it. Forbid, thou who

We have had but small takings to-day; men have

drink so slowly. May it turn to the dropsy,
that they may never be weary of drinking, but
that every draught may but make room for two
more! 'Twill never be a good world while there's
any but Welsh taverns, such as sell nothing but
ale and tobacco; these French and Spanish ones
will be the undoing of us all; men are grown such
dottrels, that they had rather give five or six shillings
to be drunk, like the Spaniard, with canary, or
the Frenchman, with claret, than so many pence to
be foxed with their own native beer.</p></div>

<i>Noble Lady, the Lady Venetia Digby. London, Printed</i>

<p class="directright">[This is one of the pieces which Isaac Reed did not
retain in the edition of 1780, nor is it in that of 1825.
Yet there is no apparent ground for its exclusion.</p>

<p>A piece bearing the same title as Rutter's was written
by Sir W. Denny at a later date, and is printed from
the original MS. in "Inedited Poetical Miscellanies,"
1870.</p>

<p>It seems to be a hypothesis sufficiently plausible to
justify a passing notice, in that one of the suppressed
printed at the end of the "Private Memoirs of
Sir Kinelm Digby," 1827, the intimacy of Digby with
a royal personage is described in very warm terms and
colours, and that Rutter, who was in Digby's family at
one time, may have founded on what came to his ears
the episode of Sylvia and Thyrsis in this production.]</p>

<p>This author wrote in the reign of Charles the First.
He lived with the Earl of Dorset, as tutor to his son,
and translated, at the desire of his patron, the Cid of
Corneille, a tragi-comedy, in two parts [1640-50, 8<sup>o</sup>].
It appears, from his dedication of this pastoral to Sir
Kenelm Digby, that he lived also with that gentleman
for some time, but in what capacity I cannot tell. The
plainness and simplicity of this pastoral is commended
by Thomas May, author of "The Heir" and "The Old
Couple;" and also by Ben Jonson in the following
lines&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">To this fair company I am to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You're welcome all to a well-meaning play;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To defame none. His muse is innocent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A virgin yet, that has not found the ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of foul crimes to raise herself a praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore she desires you would excuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All bitter strains, that suit a satire muse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that which so much takes the vulgar ear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looseness of speech, which they for jests do hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hopes none such are here, therefore she dares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venture this story, purg'd from lighter airs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A piece entire, without or patch or maim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round in itself, and everywhere the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if there be not in't what they call wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There might have been, had it been thought so fit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shepherd's muse gently of love does sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with it mingles no impurer thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such she presents unto your ears and eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet your Christian freedom not denies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of liking or disliking what you will:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may say this is well, or that is ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without dispute; for why should you that pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what you have, be taught what you should say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or made to judge by any square or rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if you came not to a stage, but school?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, he that made it says, if you will eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will not force your stomachs: there's your meat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which if you like, 'tis well; if not, all's one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There must be difference in opinion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, he's sure, whatever he could wish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your taste, and not his art, must praise the dish.<br /></span>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>Dr Jasper Fisher, a gentleman's son, born in Bedfordshire,
and entered a Commoner of Magdalen Hall
in 1607, is declared by Wood<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> to be the author of this
play. He afterwards took the degrees in arts, became
divinity or philosophy reader of Magdalen College;
rector of Wilden, Bedfordshire about 1631, and at
length doctor of divinity. Besides this play he published
some sermons. Oldys in his MSS. notes says he
was blind. At what time he died is unknown. The
title of this performance does not inform us when it
was acted, nor is it spoken of as a republication.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Langbaine
mentions no other edition but that of 1633, [nor
is any other known, or believed to exist].</p>

end of Act iii. is one in the Scottish dialect. Hence a conjecture
has been hazarded, either that the author was a
Scotchman, or that the song was introduced to please King
James. If so, the play must have been written and represented
before 1625; but there is no evidence that James
was ever present when it was performed.&mdash;<i>Collier.</i></p></div></div>

won the battle of Allia against the Romans, and in consequence
of it made himself master of their city, which he
entered about the year 363 from its foundation, and committed
every excess which wanton barbarity could dictate.
After continuing there some time, he was defeated and driven
out of it by Camillus, then an exile, but created dictator on
the occasion.</p></div>

of Henry IV.," act v. sc. 5), is a Welsh word, and primitively
signifies a sprout, a sucker; and by the writers of this
period is almost perpetually used for progeny. So in Chaloner's
translation of Erasmus's "Praise of Folie," 1549, sig.
D 3: "Yet truly more pernicious was he to the common-weale,
in leavying so ungracious an <i>ympe</i> as Commodus was,"

the Capitol, and in the night attempted to scale the ramparts.
The attempt was rendered abortive by the cackling of some
geese consecrated to Juno, which were kept as sacred birds,
and which being heard, gave an alarm to the garrison in time
enough to save the place they defended.</p></div>

by Mr Reed than any other in the whole collection.
Nevertheless, several errors crept in some of them from
following the blunders of the old copy, although that is not
so incorrect as many others of the same date. In a few instances
the punctuation was neglected or mistaken, and
such was the case with the passage in the text. It is evident
that the ghosts of Camillus are to "incite their countrymen
when night and sleep conquer the eyes," from scene 7 of
act ii., where they work alternately upon Nennius and C&aelig;sar,
who are in "night-robes." Till now the wrong pointing obscured
the sense. See also act v., scene 2.&mdash;<i>Collier.</i></p></div>

than <i>Thule</i>, nor any one about the situation of which there
has been a greater variety of opinions. Sir Robert Sibbald,
in the additions to Camden, has given a discourse concerning
the <i>Thule</i> of the ancients, in which the sentiments of
different writers on this subject are considered, and many
of them refuted. Camden supposes <i>Shetland</i> to be the
place so often distinguished by the name of <i>Thule</i>; and
Bishop Gibson appears to agree with him in the conjecture.

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Phy.</span> Thus then in short:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These noble kingdoms, Thessaly and Sparta,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have, from the time two kings commanded all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under both titles still been emulous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jealous of th' advantages which each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suspected might be in the adverse party.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This caused a lasting war; but the fierce storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threaten'd not till the reign of these two kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both crowned young, both of an equal age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both having all the passions of their subjects,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fears excepted. The ambassadors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That should congratulate the new-made kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if one spirit had inspired both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came with this message, little varied&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That each were joy'd in such an enemy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the fearful wisdom of old men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should rust their swords, that fate had given to one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Command of all." In short, their forces met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in ten bloody days none could decide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which had the better cause:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The virtues of each prince so prevalent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune was but spectator. To conclude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urgent affairs at home compell'd each king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave their armies. Ours committed his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Strimon, father of Prince Lysicles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Duke of Argos did command the Spartan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, swoll'n with the great name of general,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his king had hardly left the fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this great army, draws his forces out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fac'd us in our trenches. 'Tis not yet<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Unquestion'd whether fear or policy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made Strimon keep in his: but certainly this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That virtue, sharpen'd by necessity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Procur'd our triumph. Here Lysicles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anticipated years unto his fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the wounds of his brave enemy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did write his story, which our virgins sing.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<p>At interest, that is not peevish; then th' acquaintance

carry my wife's commendations; and if their husbands
be not at home, I do commend myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> For what, I prythee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> For a good dancer, a good rider, a good

wish mine and all for the public good, and wear
my horns with as much confidence, as the best

better fathers than they were destined to by their
mothers' marriages.</p>

by honest women's practices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> And this done voluntarily, which you will
hardly avoid, though you have a thousand guards
to prevent it. I, that have been your playfellow,
shall be first suspected, and first banished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> By Jupiter, never! No, though 'twould
preserve a thousand smooth foreheads. If she be
honest, your arts cannot alter her; and if otherwise,
had I not rather adopt a son of thine than a
stranger's? And confess truly, Cleon: would you
not for this public benefit be content to sacrifice a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
sister, that we might love no longer by obligations,
but affection; and seeing, liking, and enjoying,
finished in a meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> Unless I had means to appropriate one, you
cannot suspect but I should wish a title unto all.
But what hopes have you of your mistress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> No airy ones of liking and affection; but
mine are built on <i>terra firma</i> already, which her
father looks on greedily, and proportions this to
that grandchild, to the second this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> Is he not somewhat startled at the report of
thy debauchery? For though your thickset woods
and spreading vineyards make excellent shades to
keep away the sun&mdash;I mean the piercing eye of
censure&mdash;yet some suspicions common fame will
raise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> Indeed it was my enemy, whilst my elder
brother lived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> But since his death you are altered. I
must confess it, for then the slenderness of your
annuity allowed you but the election of some one
sin: I mean a cherished sin, whilst the others
repined, that thought themselves of equal dignity;
in time they had their turns, yet singly still: but
since your brother's death you have shown yourself
a grateful gentleman, and recompensed those that
have suffered for you to the full.</p>

he never did receive so great a one from

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> They are his own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> I pray read them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> What have I deserved of you, good Cleon,
that you should make me read his verses in his
own presence? If you think I have not already
as ill an opinion of him as I can have, you lose
your labour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> Read them, and I'll assure you you'll find
things well said and seriously; and you will alter
your opinion of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Pray give them me, I long to be working
wonders. [<i>She reads single words.</i>] <i>Rubies</i>, <i>Pearls</i>,
<i>Roses</i>, <i>Heaven</i>. Do you not think he has done my
cousin a simple favour, comparing of her voice to
that of heaven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> 'Tis his love makes him do it; not finding
any thing on earth fit to express her, he searcheth
heaven for a similitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Alas! good gentleman, 'tis the first time he
ever thought on't; what frequent thunders should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
I hear, if 'twere as he would have it? Let me
counsel you: lay them aside till they have contracted
an inch of dust, then with your finger write
their epitaph, expressing the mutual quiet they
gave men, and received from them; or, as all
poisons serve for some use, give them your physician,
and let him apply them to his patient for a
vomit&mdash;this way they may be useful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> However you esteem them, such an elogy
would make you think your glass had not yet
flattered you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> It cannot; I prevent it, and accuse it for
not showing the hills of snow, the rubies, and the
roses they say have being from me. But stay&mdash;heaven
opens, and I see a tempest coming; your
poet is a prophet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> I'll call an oath to be my witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> My own fears light upon me, if the night
that eves the day of marriage, doth not shut me
from the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> Why, madam, this intemperance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> 'Tis a just anger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> If you are angry, madam, with all that
love you, there lives none that has more enemies,
every eye that looks upon you you must hate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Sir Cleon, our friends are engaged; pray let
us be o' th' party. What has called up this choler
in my sweet cousin? My lord, you have been
begging favours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> Yes, of heaven, that it would furnish me
with merits fit to deserve your cousin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> When it has [been] granted you, return to
her, and renew your suit; but if you stay till
then, you must get spectacles to see her beauty
with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> Why should you hinder your repose and
mine? You know I never loved you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Then he has no reason to accuse you of inconstancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> Why are you fair? or why has my stars
enforced me to love nothing else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> If your love were considerable, what an
obligation had your cousin to your stars? Then
these remonstrances of yours are impulsive, and
not voluntary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> I cannot tell; but when I seriously direct
them to you, I'll swear I am bewitched.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> Madam, this is repugnant to your other
virtues, that you should hate a man for loving you.
Before he did profess himself your servant, I know
you did receive him with indifferency at least.
Whence then proceeds your hate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> From his expression of his love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> A cruel son sprung from so mild a father,
if he did urge you to anything, might blast your
honour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> She would not hear him; and as it is, how
much does he oblige her? He's now her servant,
and would entreat her to let him be her master;
a request strangely modest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> If I were he, I'd take an honourable composition,
let her choose whom she pleas'd for husband,
and continue her secret servant still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pin.</span> My lord, you are not practised in the
cares of fathers: I thought to have seen this
gentleman my son to-morrow; and she does refuse
him. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lys.</span> It must not be; pardon me, virtue, that I
begin an act will set a stain upon my blushing
brow. Yet I must thorough. Lord Pindarus, my
fortunes carry a pardon with them, when they
make me err in acts of ceremonial decencies, they
have been so heavy and so mighty, they have bent
me so low to th' earth, I could not cast my face
upwards to hope a blessing; the cause you are
perfect in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pin.</span> 'Tis a noble sorrow; but your deep melancholy
gives it too large a growth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lys.</span> Thus all do press it; yet had my grief
relation only to myself, I would not part them
from; my heart and memory they justly do possess.
But my father hath no more issue save myself,
for to confer his name and fortunes on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pin.</span> Our Greece would mourn if such a
glorious stock should end in the most flourishing
branch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lys.</span> If you do wish it a continuance, 'tis in your
power to make it last to ages. Since my Milesia's
death, I have not loved a lady equal with your
Hermione; in her I hope to lose my swollen misfortunes,
and find out a joy that may extinguish them.
'Tis now no time to tell her how much I am her
servant; for this lord here, that does pretend to
her fair graces, before I had declared myself his
rival&mdash;perchance you would believe me if I had
said, he no way doth deserve her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pin.</span> Where you pretend, who can? But heaven,
that designed a blessing to my child, it had been
pride to hope for, hath made her still averse to his
pretences; but giving her the liberty of refusing, I
know he is removed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lys.</span> Thus then to-morrow I'll wait on you.
Ladies, I am your servant. <span class="directline">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pin.</span> My Lord Ergasto, you see with how much
candour I have embraced your love; yet, though
I do put on a father's strictness in my daughter's
presence, I cannot force her to an act whereon for
ever will depend her happiness. My house shall
still be open to you as my heart. My business

the contrary.</p>

Elysium?</p>

forget all things that has no reference to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> Heyday! if within these two hours you do
not forget the cause of this forgetfulness, I'll be
an eunuch. What, if the prince should be your
rival? I cannot tell, but my Lord Pindarus on a

ceremony to you might be suspected.</p>

of obtaining my mistress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Then thou hast yet a year of happiness:
but why, I prythee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> She is so deserving, she thinks none
worthy of her affections, and so can love none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> You have more cause to doubt that she
will never affect you, than that already she is not
in love: what, a young handsome lady, that carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
the flame of her heart in her cheeks, not have yet
seen any one to desire? 'Tis impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> I was of your mind, till I had experience
of the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Conceit<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> of yourself makes you of the
opinion I mentioned. You think 'tis impossible for
all men, what you cannot attain to; what arts
have you used to gain her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> He knows none but distilling sighs at the
altar of her beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> If he be subject to that frenzy, I will
counsel him to take any trade upon him rather
than that of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> And do you think there is anything fitter
to call down affection than submission?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Nothing more opposite; for languishing
transports, whinings and melancholy make us more
laughed at than beloved of our mistresses&mdash;and
with reason: for why should we hope to deserve
their favours, when we confess we merit not a
lawful esteem of ourselves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> I have known some their mistresses have
forsaken, only because they were certain the world
took notice they were deeply in love with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> And they did wisely; for, the victory
being got, they were to prepare for a new triumph,
and not, like your city officers, ride still with the
same liveries. Some (I confess) have miscarried
in it, but 'twas because their provision of beauty
was spent before they came to composition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> Thou wert an excellent fool in a chamber;
if you continue, you'll be so in a comedy. Dost
believe thou can'st swagger them out of their
loves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Sooner than soften their hearts by my
tears; and though a river should run through me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>I would seal up my eyes, before a drop should come
that way: for our unmanly submissions raise them
to that height, that they think we are largely
favoured if they hearken to us with contempt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> 'Tis safer they should do so, than hate us
for our insolence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> If thou hadst ever been used to talk sense,
I should wonder at thee now; why, I should
sooner hope to gain a lady after the murder of her
family, than after she had an opinion I deserved
to be slighted by her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> 'Fore Venus, he talks with authority. I
know not well what he has said; but methinks
there is something in it: prythee, let's hearken to
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Do; and if I do not dispossess you of all
your opinions, let me be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> You must deal by enchantment then;
for I am resolved to stick to my conclusions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> 'Tis the best holdfast your foolish devil
has; but strong reasons shall be your exorcism.
Tell me first, what is she you love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> Would I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Then, for all thy jesting, there's some
hope thou art yet in thy wits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> You mistake me; I mean I could not tell,
because no tongue can speak her to her merit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Heyday! if the ballad of the rose and
honeycomb do not do it more than she deserves,
or almost any woman, let me be condemned to
sing the funerals of parrots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> Would the ladies heard you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> They would believe me, though they
would be sorry your honours should. But what,
this love&mdash;has it transformed us all? Cleon, you
can tell who 'tis he thus admires?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> Yes, and will; 'tis Hermione, Pindarus his
heir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> What, Epictetus in a petticoat! She that
disputes love into nothing&mdash;or, what's worse, a
friendship with a woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> The same; and I know you'll confess she's
deserving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Yes; but the mischief is, she'll ne'er
think so of him. If polygamy were in fashion, I
would persuade him to marry her, to be governess
to the rest; but not till then. Wouldst thou be
content to lie with a statue, that will never confess
more of love than suffering the effects of thine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> And have his liberties in the discourse of
her friends, that her retiredness may be more
magnified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Believe me, Ergasto, these severe beauties,
that are to be looked on with the eyes of respect,
are not for us: we must have them, that love to
be praised more for fair ladies than judicious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> You mistake me, gentlemen; I choose for
myself, not for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Faith, for that, whoever marries, must
sacrifice to fortune; and she, whose wisdom makes
her snow to you may be fire to another. Some
odd wrinkled fellow, that conquers her with wit,
may throw her on her back with reason. Take
this from the oracle, that for the general calamity
of husbands all women are reputed vicious, and
for the quiet of particulars every one thinks his
wife the ph&oelig;nix.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> You have met with rare fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Calumny is so general, that truth has lost
her credit. But to th' purpose&mdash;what rivals?
what hopes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> A potent rival takes away all: Lysicles
does woo her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Good night. I will dispute it no more,
whether thou shouldst have her or no; for I now
conclude it is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> I had her father's firm consent before he
declared himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Though thou hadst hers too, be wise, and
despair betimes. In this point women are commonwealths,
and are obliged to their faiths no farther
than the safety and honour of the state is concerned.
If thou wert the first example, I would
excuse thee for being the first cosened. But stay,
who's here?</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> If I should weep, as my lady does, for all
the servants I have lost!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Thou wouldst weep in thy grave, Phillida;
yet the worst is, thou wilt lose more within this
seven years than thou hast got in ten; for men
are changeable, sweet Phillida.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> And our faces were not, 'twere no matter.
They should make haste, or we should overtake
them, or prevent them. A commodity of beauty,
that would last forty years, would bear a good
price, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> By Venus, would it, Phillida! as high as
that of honour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> But is not my lady a strange woman to
weep thus for one servant, when she has another
in his place? For my part, I could never find
such differences in men&mdash;to be sad when I had
any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> And thy word may be taken as soon as
any wench's in Greece, or there be slanderers in
the world. But she affects constancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Some ill-favoured woman, that meant to
preserve her last purchase, which her want of beauty
forfeited, invented that name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Thou'rt in the right, Phillida; this inconstancy
is a monster without teeth, for it devours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>none, makes no son wear happy mourning, nor
mother childless: and, for my part, I am of opinion
that the gods give a blessing to it; for none live
happier than those that have greatest abundance
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> What is got by this whining constancy,
but the loss of that beauty for one servant, which
would procure us the vows, [the] sacrifice, and
service of a thousand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Enough of this; wert thou with Ergasto?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Yes, and told him that my lady sent for
him: but to what intent did you make me lie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Thou art so good-natured, that thou wilt
pardon such a trifle for one reason; but I have
two: the first is, I would fain speak with him;
the other, knowing my cousin to be in an ill
humour, if he press to see her, I hope she will give
him such an answer, that he shall never dare to
speak to her more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> These men have less reason than mice:
they would know else how to shift places, and
shelter themselves from a storm. If I were a man,
and lost the happiness of seeing my mistress two
days, I should lose the desire the third. [<i>Aside.</i>]
Do you sigh, madam? You are in love too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> As far as goes to sighing, but no dying, for
their breeches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> I'll be your compurgator for the handle
of a fan; I know love has brought many into the
world, but let out none. Has he pierced you, ha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> O no, my skin was always proof against
his dart; but he once found me laughing, and so
thrust it down to my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Look to it, though 'tis but a little weapon,
yet I have known it make greater swellings than
the sting of a bee. Do you long for a man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Yes, a husbandman, and let the gods after
take care for my children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> You'll find enou' to do it: is the Moor
still with my lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> I left her with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> 'Tis a shame such people should be
suffered near the Court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Why, prythee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> As 'tis, there be so many inquisitive
rascals, that we have much ado to keep matters
secret; but if in despite of our care they be
divulged, we shall be defamed on the Exchanges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Thou hast reason, but she is secret as the
night she resembles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Is she? I would fain ask her one question:
but 'tis no matter: 'tis but taking physic at the
worst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> If thou talk'st a little longer, I shall guess
as much as she knows. But who's here?</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> I do, madam, and should be proud to hear
I live in her memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Can you doubt it? I'll assure you you do;
she's never troubled with anything, but you presently
are called into the comparison with it; her
teeth cannot ache, but she swears it is almost as
great a vexation as your love: if any die, out of
her pity to save the tears of a few mourners, she
wishes it were you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> If I heard her desire it, she should quickly
have her wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> She would be glad on't, o' my conscience,
though the scruple, of having you do anything for
her sake would trouble her a little; yet I can teach
you to make advantage of all this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> What advantage, my delicate sweet lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> A very great one; for, first, I believe he
desires nothing more than to be assured she
esteems him for her servant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Right; but does this usage show it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Most evidently; for, being thus severe to
none else, 'tis manifest she confesseth a power over
him, and pays his services with this coin of scorn
and contempt, and having her stamp upon't, he is
bound to accept it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> What think you of this, Phormio?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> A most excellent girl! would she were
poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> Why poor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> She would live rarely by her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cle.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Wit! I would be a good customer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> 'Twould please you to hear with what
arguments she justifies this cruelty, and swears it
is not revenge enough for spoiling her good
nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> I spoil her good nature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Nay, let her go on; I'll hearken an age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ire.</span> Yes, you, by suff'ring her undeserved scorn,
have bred such a delight and habit of it in her,
that she can hardly forbear it when she strives to
be complaisant to her best friends; and, to say
truth, we are all endangered by such as you, when
we see that frowns procure us knees, and kind
usage scarce gets us two good-morrows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> If ever there were a Sybil at sixteen,
this lady is one. By this day, you have a high

Ergasto, wilt thou be happy? Marry this lady!
Wilt thou be revenged on thy proud mistress?
Marry her! Wilt thou be sure to father wise
children? Do as I bid thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> I will deal truly with thee: she has taken
my heart out of Hermione's keeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phor.</span> Be thankful, and bestow it upon her in
recompense; she will accept it, doubt not; she has
taken such pains to redeem it. Look how she casts
her eyes upon thee! She's thine own for ever, and
has been long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> I am desperately in love.</p>

Turn in your eyes upon your beauties and perfections,

to lose the empire they have gained upon our

never so much traitor as to pay homage to any

any manumit, before we license them to part, they
do usurp a power is ours by nature. The posture
I found you in was more than ordinary courtship
gives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erg.</span> You might condemn it, had not you been
the cause on't. I ne'er think of your name but
with a reverence great as I pay the gods; and
they allow us bending to their images when we
transfer our vows. The fair Irene is worthy all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
have not the hope of you; but whilst you give me

of those who are so distant from your merit.</p>
